<p align="center"> I am Frederick Cortez, a new and upcoming full-stack developer based in Dallas, Texas. I enjoy learning new ways to improve my code, and career, and be satisfied with my work. I started my coding journey with Js, CSS, and HTML, eager to learn more about other languages. My motivation to learn anything I can pushes me to continue my career in software development. </p>
